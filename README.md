<h2 align="center">Project Introduction</h2>

This project presents the **design** and **implementation of a Student Course Registration System using a relational database model**. It aims to simulate how a fictional university manages student registrations, course offerings, instructor assignments, prerequisites, and academic records. The system is built entirely with **SQL**, covering schema design, table creation, constraints enforcement, and data manipulation.

To reflect real-world scenarios, the dataset includes **manually generated dummy data featuring null values, empty fields, and duplicate entries, enabling a realistic environment for practicing data analysis and integrity checks**. Core components of the project include an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**, **SQL scripts for database creation**, **sample data population**, and **practical query operations**. The project emphasizes **data integrity**, **normalization, and the use of SQL for efficient information retrieval and validation**, making it a strong foundation for understanding database systems in academic or enterprise environments.

## üéØ Aim
To design and implement a robust relational database system that effectively manages student registrations, course offerings, instructor assignments, and academic performance, while simulating real-world data scenarios involving missing values, nulls, and duplicate records, using SQL for data modeling, manipulation, and analysis.

## üß© Problem Statement
Modern universities manage thousands of students, courses, instructors, and class enrollments each semester. Without a centralized system, tracking course offerings, managing student registrations, assigning instructors, and recording grades becomes inefficient and error-prone. This project aims to design and implement a relational database that addresses these challenges by providing a structured way to:

- Store and manage student information.

- Maintain a catalog of courses and prerequisites.

- Track course offerings for each semester.

- Record instructor assignments.

- Handle student course registrations and grades.

## ‚úÖ Objectives

### 1. Analyze the Problem Domain

- **Identify key entities (e.g., Students, Courses, Enrollments) and define their relationships and data requirements.**
  
  | Entity              | Description                                                        | Key Attributes                                         |

  1. Students ‚Üî Enrollments
     Type: One-to-Many
     Explanation: A single student can enroll in multiple course offerings, but each enrollment record refers to only one student.
     Implementation: StudentID in Enrollments is a foreign key referencing Students.

  2. Courses ‚Üî CourseOfferings
     Type: One-to-Many
     Explanation: Each course can be offered in different semesters (e.g., CS101 may be offered in Fall and Spring).
     Implementation: CourseID in CourseOfferings is a foreign key referencing Courses.

  3. Instructors ‚Üî CourseOfferings
     Type: One-to-Many
     Explanation: One instructor can teach multiple course offerings.
     Implementation: InstructorID in CourseOfferings is a foreign key referencing Instructors.

  4. CourseOfferings ‚Üî Enrollments
     Type: One-to-Many
     Explanation: A course offering can have many students enrolled, but each enrollment belongs to only one offering.
     Implementation: OfferingID in Enrollments is a foreign key referencing CourseOfferings.

  5. Courses ‚Üî Prerequisites
     Type: Many-to-Many (Self-Referencing)
     Explanation: A course can have multiple prerequisites, and a course can be a prerequisite for multiple other courses.
     Implementation: Prerequisites table acts as a bridge with composite keys CourseID and PrerequisiteID.

- **Data understanding**
  
  To simulate a realistic environment for the Student Course Registration System, synthetic data was manually generated for each table. Each table contains 500 rows, designed to include various data quality challenges such as null values, empty cells, and duplicates, 
  which reflect real-world database inconsistencies and provide a solid foundation for data integrity enforcement and validation through SQL.
  Below is a breakdown of each table, its key attributes, and its structure:
  

  | Table Name       | Number of Rows | Number of Columns  |  Key Columns                                                  |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Students**        | 500            | 7                  | StudentID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone, Major, Year    |
| **Courses**         | 500            | 5                  | CourseID, CourseCode, Title, Credits, Department             |
| **Instructors**     | 500            | 5                  | InstructorID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Department         |
| **CourseOfferings** | 500            | 5                  | OfferingID, CourseID, Semester, InstructorID, Schedule       |
| **Enrollments**     | 500            | 5                  | EnrollmentID, StudentID, OfferingID, EnrollmentDate, Grade   |
| **Prerequisites**   | 500            | 2                  | CourseID, PrerequisiteID                                     |

### 2.  Design an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)

#### Star Schema

The central fact table connects directly to multiple denormalized dimension tables. Dimension tables have redundant data but simplify queries with fewer joins while using Star Schema. use If the focus is on fast querying and reporting (like analyzing student enrollments, grades, course offerings), and simpler, flatter tables.

- Fact Table: Enrollments (records each registration with facts like Grade, EnrollmentDate)

- Dimension Tables: Students, Courses, Instructors, CourseOfferings, and Prerequites

**Note** All dimensions link directly to the fact table, and dimension tables are denormalized, meaning no further normalization (splitting) inside dimensions.

                   |
                   |
[Instructors] ‚Äî [Enrollments] ‚Äî [Courses]
                   |
               [CourseOfferings]


#### Snowflake Schema

An extension of star schema where dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables, reducing redundancy but increasing complexity and join operations. use If a more normalized structure to save storage space or maintain data integrity is needed, especially when dimension attributes have hierarchical relationships.

- Courses split into Courses and Departments (department becomes a separate table linked to Courses)

- Students may link to Majors table rather than storing major info directly

- Instructors linked to Departments similarly

- CourseOfferings could link to Semesters as a separate table

- Apply business rules using constraints (e.g., valid grade ranges, mandatory fields) to enforce data quality and consistency.

### 6. Write and Execute SQL Queries for Analysis

- Develop queries to:

- Retrieve student transcripts

- Identify enrollment trends

- Detect data issues (e.g., duplicates, missing prerequisites)

- Summarize course loads for instructors and departments

### 7. Optional: Create SQL Views for Abstraction

- Build virtual tables (views) for simplified access to complex joins, such as:

- StudentTranscriptView

- InstructorScheduleView

### 8. Reflect on Data Cleaning Needs

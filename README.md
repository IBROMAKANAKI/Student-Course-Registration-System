<h2 align="center">Project Introduction</h2>

This project presents the **design** and **implementation of a Student Course Registration System using a relational database model**. It aims to simulate how a fictional university manages student registrations, course offerings, instructor assignments, prerequisites, and academic records. The system is built entirely with **SQL**, covering schema design, table creation, constraints enforcement, and data manipulation.

To reflect real-world scenarios, the dataset includes **manually generated dummy data featuring null values, empty fields, and duplicate entries, enabling a realistic environment for practicing data analysis and integrity checks**. Core components of the project include an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**, **SQL scripts for database creation**, **sample data population**, and **practical query operations**. The project emphasizes **data integrity**, **normalization, and the use of SQL for efficient information retrieval and validation**, making it a strong foundation for understanding database systems in academic or enterprise environments.

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To design and implement a robust relational database system that effectively manages student registrations, course offerings, instructor assignments, and academic performance, while simulating real-world data scenarios involving missing values, nulls, and duplicate records, using SQL for data modeling, manipulation, and analysis.

## âœ… Objectives

### 1. Analyze the Problem Domain

- Identify key entities (e.g., Students, Courses, Enrollments) and define their relationships and data requirements.

### 2.  Design an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)

- Create a logical model representing how the entities interact, including one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

### 3. Implement the Relational Schema in SQL

- Write CREATE TABLE scripts with appropriate data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints (e.g., UNIQUE, CHECK).

### 4. Simulate Real-World Data Challenges

- Populate tables with manually generated dummy data that includes:

- Empty fields and NULL values

- Duplicate entries

### 5. Inconsistent or edge-case values (e.g., invalid grades, blank emails)

- Ensure Data Integrity and Validation

- Apply business rules using constraints (e.g., valid grade ranges, mandatory fields) to enforce data quality and consistency.

### 6. Write and Execute SQL Queries for Analysis

- Develop queries to:

- Retrieve student transcripts

- Identify enrollment trends

- Detect data issues (e.g., duplicates, missing prerequisites)

- Summarize course loads for instructors and departments

### 7. Optional: Create SQL Views for Abstraction

- Build virtual tables (views) for simplified access to complex joins, such as:

- StudentTranscriptView

- InstructorScheduleView

### 8. Reflect on Data Cleaning Needs

- Use SQL to identify and potentially isolate records that need cleaning or manual correction.
